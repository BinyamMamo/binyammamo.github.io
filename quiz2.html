    {
      "id": 1,
      "question": "According to the socioecological model, which of the following best explains why a highly educated individual might still engage in unhealthy behaviors?",
      "options": [
        "Education always ensures healthy behavior",
        "Environmental and social influences can override individual knowledge",
        "Genetics completely determines behavior",
        "Employment status has no influence on behavior"
      ],
      "correct": 1,
      "explanation": "The socioecological model identifies complex levels and interrelationships that influence health. Even highly educated individuals may struggle with healthy behaviors due to environmental factors (lack of green space, unsafe neighborhoods) and social influences (peer pressure, community norms) that can override individual knowledge. Environmental and social determinants can create significant barriers to making healthy choices regardless of education level."
    },
    {
      "id": 2,
      "question": "Which health model suggests that a person's perception of disease severity influences their behavior change?",
      "options": [
        "Socioecological Model",
        "Health Belief Model",
        "Transtheoretical Model",
        "Behaviorism Theory"
      ],
      "correct": 1,
      "explanation": "The Health Belief Model explains how health behaviors are influenced by four key perceptions: perceived susceptibility, perceived seriousness of consequences (disease severity), perceived benefits of action, and perceived barriers. A person's belief about how serious a disease or condition is and its potential impact on their life directly influences their motivation to change behavior."
    },
    {
      "id": 3,
      "question": "A woman avoids public parks due to safety concerns in her neighborhood, reducing her physical activity. Which determinant is most at play?",
      "options": [
        "Genetic",
        "Individual knowledge",
        "Environmental",
        "Cultural"
      ],
      "correct": 2,
      "explanation": "This reflects environmental determinants - specifically the built environment. Safety concerns in public parks represent a geographical barrier within the environment that prevents physical activity. Environmental factors like safe neighborhoods and green spaces encourage physical activity, while unsafe environments act as barriers even when individuals understand the benefits of exercise."
    },
    {
      "id": 4,
      "question": "Despite knowing the dangers, a teenager smokes to fit in with friends. This scenario best reflects the influence of:",
      "options": [
        "Media",
        "Peers",
        "Religion",
        "Genetics"
      ],
      "correct": 1,
      "explanation": "This demonstrates the powerful impact of peer influence on health behaviors. The socioecological model identifies that friends and community norms significantly affect health opportunities and choices. Even when individuals know the risks, social pressure from peers can override individual knowledge, as the desire to fit in becomes a stronger motivator than health concerns."
    },
    {
      "id": 5,
      "question": "Which of the following is an example of epigenetics?",
      "options": [
        "A person inheriting blue eyes",
        "Air pollution triggering gene changes passed to offspring",
        "A dominant gene for height",
        "A family history of heart disease"
      ],
      "correct": 1,
      "explanation": "Epigenetics refers to chemical modifications that alter DNA without changing the nucleotide sequence, which can activate or repress gene expression. These changes are influenced by the environment and can be passed to offspring. Air pollution triggering gene changes that are inherited is a direct example of environmental factors causing epigenetic modifications that affect future generations."
    },
    {
      "id": 6,
      "question": "In the Stages of Change Model, which stage does someone say, 'Maybe I should think about quitting smoking'?",
      "options": [
        "Precontemplation",
        "Contemplation",
        "Preparation",
        "Maintenance"
      ],
      "correct": 1,
      "explanation": "The Contemplation stage is characterized by individuals considering making a change, often thinking 'Well... maybe'. This stage involves acknowledging the possibility of change without yet committing to specific steps. The phrase 'Maybe I should think about quitting smoking' indicates the person is weighing options but hasn't made a firm commitment to action."
    },
    {
      "id": 7,
      "question": "A health professional helps a client set specific, measurable steps toward losing weight. This reflects which behavior change plan element?",
      "options": [
        "Self-efficacy",
        "Relapse prevention",
        "Goal setting",
        "Knowledge transfer"
      ],
      "correct": 2,
      "explanation": "This demonstrates goal setting using SMART goals (Specific, Measurable, Attainable, Realistic, Time-bound). Setting specific, measurable steps directly aligns with structured goal-setting frameworks that are crucial for behavior change. While self-efficacy and relapse prevention are important, the direct action described is the formulation of structured objectives."
    },
    {
      "id": 8,
      "question": "A patient with diabetes cannot attend frequent check-ups due to living 3 hours from the nearest specialist. This best reflects:",
      "options": [
        "Sociocultural factor",
        "Socioeconomic factor",
        "Environmental determinant",
        "Individual skill factor"
      ],
      "correct": 2,
      "explanation": "This represents an environmental determinant - specifically geographical barriers within the built environment. Living 3 hours from the nearest specialist creates a physical access barrier to healthcare. Environmental factors include physical aspects of where people live that influence health opportunities and access to services, including healthcare accessibility."
    },
    {
      "id": 9,
      "question": "Which statement about health disparities is FALSE?",
      "options": [
        "They always result from genetics",
        "They can be caused by systemic policies",
        "Rural residents may face more health barriers",
        "Race and ethnicity influence disparities"
      ],
      "correct": 0,
      "explanation": "Health disparities are differences in health outcomes that result from systemic and avoidable social and economic practices and policies, not solely genetics. While genetics interact with environmental factors, health disparities are primarily driven by social, economic, geographic, and policy factors rather than genetic differences alone."
    },
    {
      "id": 10,
      "question": "Which scenario BEST shows the interaction of socioeconomic and environmental factors?",
      "options": [
        "A wealthy family living near a polluted industrial area",
        "A marathon runner born with asthma",
        "A vegetarian choosing to eat meat during holidays",
        "A student choosing to skip PE class"
      ],
      "correct": 0,
      "explanation": "This scenario demonstrates how socioeconomic status (wealth) intersects with environmental hazards (pollution). Despite having high income and resources, the family is exposed to environmental health risks due to their location. This shows that even high socioeconomic status doesn't negate environmental impacts, illustrating the complex interaction between different health determinants."
    },
    {
      "id": 11,
      "question": "During a pandemic, why might lower-income individuals experience higher infection rates?",
      "options": [
        "Genetics make them more susceptible",
        "They often cannot work remotely or afford to isolate",
        "They lack awareness of the disease",
        "Vaccines are ineffective for lower-income groups"
      ],
      "correct": 1,
      "explanation": "Socioeconomic status significantly impacts health outcomes during pandemics. Lower-income individuals often work in jobs requiring in-person presence, have less ability to physically distance, work from home, or take leave. These practical constraints imposed by their economic conditions increase exposure risk, regardless of their knowledge about disease prevention."
    },
    {
      "id": 12,
      "question": "A patient refuses a blood transfusion due to religious beliefs. This is an example of what determinant?",
      "options": [
        "Socioeconomic",
        "Sociocultural",
        "Environmental",
        "Genetic"
      ],
      "correct": 1,
      "explanation": "Religious beliefs are a clear example of sociocultural determinants that shape individuals' perceptions of health, illness, and treatment. Sociocultural factors encompass cultural norms, values, and beliefs, including religious beliefs, that influence health decisions and behaviors as part of the broader social environment."
    },
    {
      "id": 13,
      "question": "Which factor most strongly predicts health outcomes according to the Teague PPT?",
      "options": [
        "Age",
        "Socioeconomic status",
        "Gender",
        "Race"
      ],
      "correct": 1,
      "explanation": "Socioeconomic status (SES) has perhaps the most significant impact on health outcomes. SES encompasses income, education, and occupation, which profoundly influence access to health-promoting resources, quality healthcare, nutritious food, safe housing, and reduces stress from financial instability. Higher income and social status consistently link to better health outcomes."
    },
    {
      "id": 14,
      "question": "A city builds more bike lanes and pedestrian paths. Which public health principle is being applied?",
      "options": [
        "Health promotion",
        "Genetic screening",
        "Disease treatment",
        "Individual behavior focus only"
      ],
      "correct": 0,
      "explanation": "This exemplifies health promotion - actions designed to maintain current health or encourage a more desirable state of health. Building bike lanes and pedestrian paths modifies the built environment to encourage physical activity and promote healthier lifestyles at a community level, making healthy choices easier for entire populations."
    },
    {
      "id": 15,
      "question": "Which of these individuals has the highest health literacy?",
      "options": [
        "A person who reads about diseases but struggles to apply information",
        "Someone who uses and evaluates health information for decisions",
        "A doctor who ignores new research findings",
        "A fitness coach who memorizes nutrition facts"
      ],
      "correct": 1,
      "explanation": "Health literacy is the ability to read, understand, and act on health information. The individual who uses and evaluates health information for decisions demonstrates all three components: reading/understanding, critically evaluating (including identifying misinformation), and applying it to make informed decisions. This goes beyond mere knowledge to practical application."
    },
    {
      "id": 16,
      "question": "A person with high perseverance and self-belief quits smoking despite social pressure. Which individual factor contributed most?",
      "options": [
        "Knowledge",
        "Attitude",
        "Skill",
        "Genetics"
      ],
      "correct": 1,
      "explanation": "This scenario points to attitude, which includes perseverance and self-belief (self-efficacy). Mentally healthy people persevere and take on challenges with a positive outlook and sense of control. Self-efficacy - feeling competent to perform a specific task - is a key component of attitude that empowers individuals to act despite external challenges like social pressure."
    },
    {
      "id": 17,
      "question": "Which combination of factors might multiply health risks most significantly?",
      "options": [
        "High income + poor education",
        "Low income + low education + poor environment",
        "Good education + poor family support",
        "High income + unhealthy diet"
      ],
      "correct": 1,
      "explanation": "The combination of low income, low education, and poor environment represents a clustering of multiple negative social determinants of health. This synergistic effect means individuals face numerous health risks simultaneously - limited access to healthcare, nutritious food, safe housing, plus environmental hazards and lack of health literacy - creating amplified vulnerability."
    },
    {
      "id": 18,
      "question": "Why might the media increase risk behaviors even without explicit peer pressure?",
      "options": [
        "Media replaces personal choice",
        "Media can normalize risky behaviors through frequent, subtle portrayals",
        "Viewers only copy what they are directly told",
        "Media is rarely influential in modern health behavior"
      ],
      "correct": 1,
      "explanation": "Media can normalize risky behaviors through frequent, subtle portrayals. Repeated exposure to certain behaviors in media, even without direct commands, can make those behaviors seem common, acceptable, or desirable. This normalization process subtly shapes perceptions and attitudes over time, influencing choices without explicit peer pressure."
    },
    {
      "id": 19,
      "question": "An immigrant family struggles to find culturally appropriate health services. This barrier is most directly related to:",
      "options": [
        "Employment status",
        "Sociocultural factors",
        "Individual genetics",
        "Technological limitations"
      ],
      "correct": 1,
      "explanation": "This highlights sociocultural factors, which include cultural norms, values, practices, and language that influence health behaviors and access to services. Cultural barriers to healthcare access include language differences, unfamiliarity with healthcare systems, or lack of providers who understand cultural contexts and beliefs."
    },
    {
      "id": 20,
      "question": "A man adopts a Mediterranean diet after learning about its heart benefits and because his peers support healthy eating. This change reflects which combined determinants?",
      "options": [
        "Individual, sociocultural, and environmental",
        "Genetic only",
        "Environmental only",
        "Individual and genetic only"
      ],
      "correct": 0,
      "explanation": "This demonstrates multiple determinants: Individual (learning about heart benefits shows knowledge and health literacy), Sociocultural (peer support for healthy eating represents social influence), and Environmental (access to Mediterranean diet foods implies a supportive food environment). The socioecological model emphasizes that individual choices are made within social and physical contexts."
    },
    {
      "id": 21,
      "question": "A woman with type A blood (genotype AO) claims a man with type AB blood fathered her child, who has type B blood. Which statement is correct?",
      "options": [
        "This is genetically impossible",
        "The child must be adopted",
        "The claim is possible only if the mother is AO",
        "The mother must have genotype AA"
      ],
      "correct": 2,
      "explanation": "For a child with type B blood to be produced, they need genotype BO. The mother (AO) can pass either A or O allele, and the father (AB) can pass either A or B allele. If the mother passes O and father passes B, the child would have BO genotype (type B blood). This is only possible if the mother is heterozygous (AO), not homozygous (AA)."
    },
    {
      "id": 22,
      "question": "Two parents with the genotype Bb (black fur is dominant) produce offspring. Which probability is correct?",
      "options": [
        "All offspring will have black fur",
        "25% chance for white fur offspring",
        "75% of offspring will be white",
        "All offspring will be heterozygous"
      ],
      "correct": 1,
      "explanation": "Using a Punnett square for Bb × Bb: 25% BB (black), 50% Bb (black), 25% bb (white). Since black is dominant, any offspring with at least one B allele will have black fur. Only bb genotype (25%) will have white fur, as white is recessive and requires two recessive alleles."
    },
    {
      "id": 23,
      "question": "Which best explains why two tall pea plants might produce short offspring?",
      "options": [
        "Tall plants can only pass on dominant alleles",
        "Both parents must be homozygous tall",
        "Both parents carried a recessive allele for shortness",
        "Shortness is a spontaneous mutation"
      ],
      "correct": 2,
      "explanation": "For short offspring to be produced from tall parents, both parents must be heterozygous (Tt) and carry the recessive allele for shortness. If both pass their recessive 't' allele, the offspring will be tt (short). This follows typical Mendelian inheritance patterns where recessive traits can appear when both parents are carriers."
    },
    {
      "id": 24,
      "question": "In incomplete dominance, crossing two pink carnations (CR CW x CR CW) results in what phenotypic ratio?",
      "options": [
        "1 red : 2 pink : 1 white",
        "3 pink : 1 white",
        "All pink",
        "2 red : 2 white"
      ],
      "correct": 0,
      "explanation": "In incomplete dominance, the heterozygous phenotype is an intermediate blend. Crossing CR CW × CR CW produces: 25% CR CR (red), 50% CR CW (pink), 25% CW CW (white). This gives the classic 1:2:1 phenotypic ratio where the heterozygous genotype has its own distinct intermediate phenotype."
    },
    {
      "id": 25,
      "question": "If two heterozygous pea plants for yellow seeds (Yy) are crossed, what's the chance of an offspring being homozygous recessive (green seeds)?",
      "options": [
        "0%",
        "25%",
        "50%",
        "75%"
      ],
      "correct": 1,
      "explanation": "Crossing Yy × Yy produces: 25% YY (yellow), 50% Yy (yellow), 25% yy (green). The homozygous recessive genotype (yy) that produces green seeds occurs in 25% of offspring. This follows the standard 3:1 phenotypic ratio for a monohybrid cross."

      "id": 26,
      "question": "Which scenario best illustrates codominance?",
      "options": [
        "A pink flower resulting from a red x white cross",
        "A flower with both red and white patches",
        "Green peas resulting from two yellow parents",
        "A tall plant crossed with a short plant producing medium height offspring"
      ],
      "correct": 1,
      "explanation": "Codominance occurs when both alleles are fully expressed simultaneously in the heterozygous phenotype. A flower with both red and white patches shows both colors distinctly, demonstrating that both alleles are being expressed without blending. This differs from incomplete dominance where traits blend to create an intermediate phenotype."
    },
    {
      "id": 27,
      "question": "Two rabbits are crossed. One is heterozygous white (Bb), and the other is homozygous black (BB). Which is true?",

        "50% of the offspring will be black",
        "All offspring will appear black",
        "25% will be white",
        "It depends on environmental factors only"
      ],
      "correct": 1,
      "explanation": "Assuming black (B) is dominant over white (b), crossing Bb × BB produces 50% BB and 50% Bb offspring. Both genotypes result in black phenotype since B is dominant. Therefore, all offspring will appear black, regardless of whether they are homozygous (BB) or heterozygous (Bb)."

      "id": 28,
      "question": "In humans, a colorblind woman (XbXb) and a man with normal vision (XBY) have children. What percentage of their sons will be colorblind?",

        "100%",
        "25%"
      ],
      "correct": 2,
      "explanation": "This is X-linked inheritance. All sons inherit their X chromosome from their mother and Y chromosome from their father. Since the mother is XbXb, all sons will inherit Xb and be XbY (colorblind). Daughters will be XBXb (carriers with normal vision). Therefore, 100% of sons will be colorblind."

        "AO x OO",
        "BO x OO"
      ],
      "correct": 1,
      "explanation": "To have blood type O, a child must have genotype OO (inherit O allele from each parent). In AB × AB cross, parents can only contribute A or B alleles, never O alleles. Therefore, offspring can only be AA, AB, or BB - never OO. All other crosses include at least one parent with an O allele."

      "correct": 1,
      "explanation": "Punnett squares predict probabilities, but real outcomes can vary due to: small sample sizes (like coin flips, small numbers may not match expected ratios), mutations (changes in genes that create unexpected phenotypes), and environmental factors that can influence gene expression. Probability applies to large numbers; small samples can deviate significantly."

      "options": [
        "To promote fat loss",
        "To prevent dehydration and maintain safe kidney function",
        "To enhance the effects of creatine on bone density",
        "To reduce the chance of muscle tremors"
      ],
      "correct": 1,
      "explanation": "Creatine causes weight gain due to increased muscle water retention. Since creatine draws water into muscle cells, athletes using creatine must drink adequate fluids to prevent dehydration and maintain safe kidney function as the body's water balance shifts."

      ],
      "correct": 1,
      "explanation": "Insulin's physiological role is to lower blood glucose. In healthy individuals who don't have diabetes, administering insulin can lead to dangerously low blood sugar (hypoglycemia), which can rapidly progress to coma and be fatal if not treated promptly. This makes insulin extremely dangerous as a PED."

        "It decreases energy availability while increasing focus",
        "It increases epinephrine, enhancing endurance, but can cause side effects like nausea and palpitations",
        "It promotes muscle protein breakdown",
        "It guarantees muscle mass gain"
      ],
      "correct": 1,
      "explanation": "Caffeine is a CNS stimulant that increases epinephrine levels, which can enhance endurance performance (3-6 mg/kg one hour before exercise). However, it can cause side effects including diuresis, nausea, muscle tremor, palpitations, and headache, making it potentially risky despite performance benefits."

      ],
      "correct": 1,
      "explanation": "ATP is the body's chemical energy for muscle contractions, but only small amounts are stored in resting cells. For prolonged activity, other energy sources (breakdown of carbohydrates and fats) are needed to generate more ATP. This limitation requires sustained energy production from macronutrients."

      ],
      "correct": 2,
      "explanation": "PEDs (like anabolic steroids, HGH, insulin) directly alter physiological processes and hormone levels beyond normal ranges, carrying severe health risks and side effects. Standard sports supplements aim to support normal physiological functions with generally lower risk profiles, even if effectiveness varies."

      "id": 77,
      "question": "Why might excessive protein intake fail to benefit an endurance athlete?",
      "options": [
        "Protein cannot be used for muscle repair",
        "The body converts excess protein to fat or excretes it without improving performance",
        "Protein blocks carbohydrate absorption",
        "High protein diets always increase endurance"
      ],
      "correct": 1,
      "explanation": "While protein is essential for muscle repair, excessive protein has not been shown to be beneficial. The body cannot store excess protein as muscle; instead, it converts extra amino acids to glucose or fat for energy/storage, or excretes nitrogen, without contributing to enhanced endurance performance."

        "Trans fats are essential for post-workout recovery"
      ],
      "correct": 2,
      "explanation": "Trans fats are bad for heart health as they raise LDL (bad cholesterol) and lower HDL (good cholesterol) levels, increasing cardiovascular disease risk. They offer no performance benefits for athletes, so limiting them supports cardiovascular health without compromising athletic performance."
