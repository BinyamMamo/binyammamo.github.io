  "chapters": [
    {

      "title": "Self, Family, and Community / Public Health & Societal Factors",
      "description": "Understanding how individual, social, and environmental factors interact to influence health outcomes, including genetics, health literacy, and behavior change models.",
      "questions": [
        {
          "id": 1,
          "question": "According to the socioecological model, which of the following best explains why a highly educated individual might still engage in unhealthy behaviors?",
          "options": [
            "Education always ensures healthy behavior",
            "Environmental and social influences can override individual knowledge",
            "Genetics completely determines behavior",
            "Employment status has no influence on behavior"
          ],
          "correct": 1,
          "explanation": "The **sociological model of health** identifies the complex levels and interrelationships that influence your health. It highlights that 'your unique set of characteristics' and 'your social and physical environments' both shape health. Factors like **friends, family, community norms, economic, social, and public policy, and even global events** affect health opportunities. Therefore, even with individual knowledge (like education), powerful environmental and social influences can create barriers to healthy behaviors."
        },
        {
          "id": 2,
          "question": "Which health model suggests that a person's perception of disease severity influences their behavior change?",
          "options": [
            "Socioecological Model",
            "Health Belief Model",
            "Transtheoretical Model",
            "Behaviorism Theory"
          ],
          "correct": 1,
          "explanation": "The **Health Belief Model** posits that health behaviors are influenced by four perceptions, one of which is the **'Perceived seriousness of consequences'**. This means that an individual's belief about how severe a disease or its consequences might be can motivate or deter them from taking action."
        },
        {
          "id": 3,
          "question": "A woman avoids public parks due to safety concerns in her neighborhood, reducing her physical activity. Which determinant is most at play?",
          "options": [
            "Genetic",
            "Individual knowledge",
            "Environmental",
            "Cultural"
          ],
          "correct": 2,
          "explanation": "**Environmental factors** that influence health can be divided into built and natural factors. The **built environment**, including safe neighborhoods, is crucial as it encourages and increases physical activity throughout the lifespan. Safety concerns within her neighborhood directly represent an environmental determinant impacting her health choices."

            "Media",
            "Peers",
            "Religion",
            "Genetics"
          ],
          "correct": 1,
          "explanation": "The **sociological model of health** explicitly identifies **'friends'** and 'family' as factors that influence your health opportunities. This scenario demonstrates how social pressure from a peer group can override individual knowledge about health risks."
        },
        {
          "id": 5,
          "question": "Which of the following is an example of epigenetics?",

            "A person inheriting blue eyes",
            "Air pollution triggering gene changes passed to offspring",
            "A dominant gene for height",
            "A family history of heart disease"
          ],
          "correct": 1,
          "explanation": "**Epigenetics** refers to chemical modifications that alter DNA without changing the nucleotide sequence, and these changes can activate or repress gene expression. The environment interacts with DNA in this way to create changes that can be passed along from generation to generation. Air pollution, an environmental factor, causing such inheritable gene changes is a direct example of epigenetics."
        },
        {
          "id": 6,
          "question": "In the Stages of Change Model, which stage does someone say, “Maybe I should think about quitting smoking”?",
          "options": [
            "Precontemplation",
            "Contemplation",
            "Preparation",
            "Maintenance"
          ],
          "correct": 1,
          "explanation": "The **Stages of Change Model** (also known as the Transtheoretical Model, TTM) outlines several phases of behavior change. The **'Contemplation'** stage is characterized by a person thinking, **'Well . . . maybe'**. This indicates an awareness of the problem and a consideration of change, but not yet a commitment to act."
        },
        {
          "id": 7,
          "question": "A health professional helps a client set specific, measurable steps toward losing weight. This reflects which behavior change plan element?",

            "Self-efficacy",
            "Relapse prevention",
            "Goal setting",
            "Knowledge transfer"
          ],
          "correct": 2,
          "explanation": "Creating a behavior change plan involves several steps, including **'Set goals'** and **'Develop action plan with SMART (Specific, Measurable, Attainable, Realistic, Time-bound) goals'**. Helping a client set specific, measurable steps directly falls under the element of goal setting."
        },
        {
          "id": 8,
          "question": "A patient with diabetes cannot attend frequent check-ups due to living 3 hours from the nearest specialist. This best reflects:",
          "options": [
            "Sociocultural factor",
            "Socioeconomic factor",
            "Environmental determinant",
            "Individual skill factor"
          ],
          "correct": 2,
          "explanation": "**Environmental factors** are identified as influences on health. Geographic barriers, such as living a considerable distance from healthcare services or specialists, are a form of **environmental determinant** that can create significant challenges for accessing necessary care, despite individual desire or knowledge."
        },
        {
          "id": 9,
          "question": "Which statement about health disparities is FALSE?",
          "options": [
            "They always result from genetics",
            "They can be caused by systemic policies",

            "Race and ethnicity influence disparities"
          ],
          "correct": 0,
          "explanation": "**Health disparities** are defined as resulting from **'systemic and avoidable social and economic practices and policies that create barriers for some groups'**. They are observed between rural and urban U.S. regions and are influenced by ethnicity and race. Therefore, the statement that they *always* result from genetics is false, as social, economic, and environmental factors are explicitly identified as key causes."
        },
        {
          "id": 10,
          "question": "Which scenario BEST shows the interaction of socioeconomic and environmental factors?",
          "options": [
            "A wealthy family living near a polluted industrial area",
            "A marathon runner born with asthma",

            "A student choosing to skip PE class"
          ],
          "correct": 0,
          "explanation": "**Social determinants of health** influence the options and choices individuals have, and **environmental factors** influence health. While a wealthy family (socioeconomic factor) has resources, their residence near a polluted industrial area (environmental factor like chemical carcinogens) demonstrates an interaction where the environment poses a risk despite socioeconomic advantages. This highlights that socioeconomic status can influence exposure to environmental carcinogens."
        },
        {
          "id": 11,
          "question": "During a pandemic, why might lower-income individuals experience higher infection rates?",

            "Vaccines are ineffective for lower-income groups"
          ],
          "correct": 1,
          "explanation": "The COVID-19 pandemic demonstrated how **socioeconomic status** significantly impacts health outcomes. People with lower incomes had **'less ability to physically distance, work from home, or take leave'**, making them more vulnerable to exposure and higher infection rates due to their work and living conditions."
        },
        {
          "id": 12,

            "Genetic"
          ],
          "correct": 1,
          "explanation": "The sources describe **ethnicity** as drawn from common ancestry and origins, including **religious** and cultural aspects. **Community norms** and broader social environments are identified as influences on health. Religious beliefs fall under **sociocultural factors**, which shape individual choices and opportunities regarding health."
        },

          ],
          "correct": 1,

            "Individual behavior focus only"
          ],
          "correct": 0,
          "explanation": "**Health promotion** is defined as 'actions designed to maintain a current health state or encourage a more desirable state of health'. Supporting active lifestyles through community planning, such as building bike lanes and pedestrian paths, directly encourages increased physical activity and a more desirable state of health. This is a clear application of health promotion at the community level."

            "A fitness coach who memorizes nutrition facts"
          ],
          "correct": 1,
          "explanation": "**Health literacy** is defined as **'the ability to read, understand and act on health information'**. An individual who can both evaluate and use health information effectively for their decisions fully embodies this definition, going beyond mere memorization or passive reading."
        },

          "correct": 1,
          "explanation": "The Stages of Change Model emphasizes **'Self-efficacy, an internal state in which you feel competent to perform a specific task, is a significant factor'** in behavior change. Perseverance and strong self-belief are indicative of a positive **attitude** and high self-efficacy, enabling an individual to overcome challenges like social pressure."

          "correct": 1,
          "explanation": "**Socioeconomic status** has the most significant impact on health outcomes, and **worse health status is strongly associated with poverty**. The sociological model of health indicates that **economic, social, and public policy** affect health opportunities, along with **social and physical environments**. A combination of low income, low education (which limits options and choices), and a poor environment (e.g., exposure to carcinogens, lack of green space) creates multiple compounding barriers and risks, leading to significantly multiplied health risks."
